load balancer is just about getting traffic into cluster
and ingress controller will adjust the routing of traffic ins≈üde the cluster 


In /etc/hosts we added line:
127.0.0.1 posts.com
|
with that line every request sent to posts.com will be directed to 127.0.0.1
that request is going to ingress-srv and nginx is gonna think we are trying to visit posts.com and will apply the routing roules in ingress-srv.yaml
