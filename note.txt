load balancer is just about getting traffic into cluster
and ingress controller will adjust the routing of traffic ins≈üde the cluster 


In /etc/hosts we added line:
127.0.0.1 posts.com
|
with that line every request sent to posts.com will be directed to 127.0.0.1
that request is going to ingress-srv and nginx is gonna think we are trying to visit posts.com and will apply the routing roules in ingress-srv.yaml

Skaffold detects changes in code and copies them straight to the container
and since the scripts in the container are run with nodemon
with every change the scripts are restarted automatically
without nodemon nod won't restart you definitely need nodemon or something like that

Quitting skaffold will close all deployments, services and pods. With that we dont have to keep them open or close them one by one.
